# Restaurant

Restaurant front-end implementation in AngularJS for David Chu's China Bistro.


The app is hosted at https://qqttss.github.io/angular-restaurant

The app was built on the course of Single Page Web Application with AngularJS with Coursera. In the process of building the app, modules, controllers, custom directives, components, services, form and form validations were used. The routing for the app is implemented with ui-router. Submitted personal information is stored by localStorage. The json data are served on heroku.

With the App, you can access menus the restaurant provides and the contact information, sign up and place orders.
